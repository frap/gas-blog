# BGP

## Information

*   Each BGP entry takes about 240 bytes of memory in the BGP table and another 240 bytes in the IP routing table. Each path takes about 110 bytes.
*   BGP uses TCP port 179.
*   BGP is connection oriented. As long as one side can establish the connection, it will work.
*   Private AS numbers: 64512-65535 (last 1024 of 16 bit block)

### BGP Route Selection Process

*   Only consider paths with reachable NEXT_HOP attributes
*   Do not consider iBGP path if not synchronized

1.  Highest WEIGHT
2.  Highest LOCAL_PREF
3.  Prefer locally originated route4.  Shortest AS_PATH
5.  Lowest ORIGIN code (IGP &lt; EGP &lt; incomplete)
6.  Lowest Multi-Exit Discriminator (MED)

        1.  IF bgp deterministic-med, order the paths before comparing2.  IF bgp always-compare-med, then compare it for all paths
    3.  Considered only if paths are from the same neighbor AS
7.  Prefer an External path over an Internal one
8.  Lowest IGP metric to the NEXT_HOP
9.  IF multipath is enabled, the router may install up to N parallel paths in the routing table
10.  For eBGP paths, select the &#8220;oldest&#8221; (To minimize route-flap)
11.  Lowest Router-ID (Originator-ID is considered for reflected routes)
12.  Shortest Cluster-List (Client must be aware of RR attributes!)
13.  Lowest neighbor IP address

#### iBGP

*   The NEXT_HOP attribute is not updated when a prefix is sent to an iBGP peer. You can use &quot;next-hop-self&quot; on the neighbor statement to solve any issues caused by that feature.
*   Applies the rule of iBGP split-horizon - an iBGP received prefix will not be propagated to another iBGP neighbor. Hence, iBGP requires a full mesh between BGP peers. There are two ways to circumvent this requirement:

        1.  Route Reflectors (route server)
    2.  Confederations (sub ASes)

#### eBGP

*   The NEXT_HOP attribute is updated when a prefix is sent to an eBGP peer (but NOT if it is a  member of the same confederation).
*   By default the eBGP neighbor is assumed to be directly connected. Consequently, the &quot;neighbor ebgp-multihop&quot; command MUST be used if the peers are not directly connected. Note: loopbacks are never directly connected - so you need to use either ebgp-multihop or disable-connected-check when peering eBGP on loopbacks...

#### Route-Reflectors

*   The NEXT_HOP attribute is preserved (same as iBGP). Because of this, if a route-reflector client is peering with an eBGP peer, you will most likely have to change the next hop to reflect the address of the RRC. That is unless you redistribute the connected external routes, of course.

#### Confederations

*   The NEXT_HOP attribute is preserved between confederation members - this is differerent from a traditional eBGP peering session.*   The MULTI_EXIT_DESC is preserved
*   The LOCAL_PREF is preserved

#### Communities

The community attribute is a transitive, optional attribute designed to group destinations in a certain community and apply certain policies (such as accept, prefer, or redistribute). The following table shows the well known BGP communities.

### Appendix

*   The most common reasons for a prefix not showing up in the routing table are:

        *   Ther router trying to advertise the prefix doesn't have it in its routing table - the prefix doesn't make it to the BGP table on the origin router.
    *   The prefix is not synchronized:

        *   <span class="content">There must be a match for the prefix in the IP routing table in order for an internal (iBGP) path to be considered a valid path.</span>*   <span class="content">If the matching route is learned from an OSPF neighbor, its OSPF router ID must match the BGP router ID of the iBGP neighbor (watch for this one on route reflectors).</span>*   There is no existing route to the BGP next hop.
*   A multihop session will not be established if the only route to the peer is a default route. A default route is never going to be used to establish a BGP session  		(iBGP/eBGP), and you will see the same (no route) output in the debugs,  		although you will be able to ping the BGP neighbor.
*   eBGP assumes directly connected peers. If doing eBGP through a FW, NAT device, etc., make sur you use the ebgp-multihop option.
*   If peering through a PIX (with identity NAT) and doing authentication, u<span class="content">se the norandomseq keyword to stop the PIX from offsetting the TCP sequence number by using a static (inside,outside) 172.16.11.1 172.16.11.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 norandomseq.</span> Authentication will not work through NAT (breaks the MD5 hash).
*   Other gotchas with NAT are: (1) make sure the NAT device has routes to the networks you want to route to and (2) make sure the next hop is consistent with the NAT addresses.*   With iBGP watch out for logical split horizon since an iBGP router does not re-send the routes it received from other iBGP peers to other iBGP peers. It requires a full mesh or a route-reflector.
*   In &quot;show ip bgp&quot; the &quot;*&gt;&quot; means that the bgp route in the bgp table was installed in the routing table.
*   To make believe you are a different AS to a peer, you can use &quot;neighbor ... local-as&quot; or confederations.
*   Use &quot;set origin&quot; in a route-map to manipulate how the origin looks like in the BGP table.
*   In &quot;show ip bgp&quot;, &quot;*&quot; means the prefix is valid, &quot;&gt;&quot; means the prefix is installed in the routing table.
*   If you have to do filtering and the question specifies &quot;use a method that is flexible to change in the future&quot;, use prefix-list - they do have sequence numbers (although names access-lists now support sequencing).*   The ip prefix-list entry 0.0.0.0/0 le 32 permits everything.*   To use &quot;aggregate-address&quot; to source a summary in your local BGP table, you must have at least one of its subnets in the routing table. Use the summary-only or suppress-map options to suppress more specific updates.*   If &quot;aggregate-address summary-only&quot; is used the sub-routes will show as suppressed in the originating router. If the question specifies that it should not be the case, use &quot;aggregate-address&quot; plus a filtering technique on the outbound.*   Route filtering can be accomplished using route-map, distribute-list (access-list), filter-list (as-path), and prefix-list (range).
*   You can use an unsuppress-map on the neighbor statement to control the behavior of an aggregate-address. However, unsupress-map and route-map cannot be used toward the same neighbor, if both are configured, the route-map will be ignored.*   Do not apply both a <span style="font-style: normal;">neighbor distribute-list </span>and a <span style="font-style: normal;">neighbor prefix-list</span> command to a neighbor in any given direction (inbound or outbound). These two commands are mutually exclusive, and only one command (<span style="font-style: normal;">neighbor prefix-list</span> or <span style="font-style: normal;">neighbor distribute-list</span>) can be applied to each inbound or outbound direction.
*   By default, iBGP redistribution into IGPs (RIP, OSPF &amp; ISIS) is disabled because it can lead to major real-life problems. To enable redistribution of iBGP routes into IGP use the bgp &quot;redistribute-internal&quot; command under the BGP routing process of the router where you want to perform the redistribution.

# Neighbor formation

BGP uses TCP 179.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
	</span>This means that when R1 initiates connection, it sends it to port 179 on
	R2.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>R2 will respond to the random source
	port though.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So the initiating router
	will have it as a random source port and answering router will have port 179.

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

If both initiate at the same time, the higher BGP router-id
	is the client.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Otherwise whoever
	initiate first is client.

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

Key thing is that the other side send packet from the IP
	have you have configured in the **neighbor**
	statement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So if there are two
	connections between 2 routers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>R1 can
	send packets from IP1 and receive packets from IP2, while R2 can receive on IP1
	and IP2, as long as the bgp neighbors are configured properly and have **update-source_._**<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Only one end is server
	so technically only need it on one side, since it decides whether to accept or
	refuse connection.

Received address or interface doesn’t matter (as long as
	exists on router). Source address is key.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
	</span>

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

# eBGP

eBGP sends out with TTL of 1.<span
	style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So if more than one hop, use **ebgp-multihop<o:p></o:p>**

eBGP does loop prevention by AS filtering.<span
	style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It will not accept path that has its own AS
	in it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is done at accepting end,
	not advertising end.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Other side will
	still advertise the prefix.

eBGP updates next-hop of route advertised.<span
	style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It updates it to be the interface where it is
	peering.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So if physical, then
	physical.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If logical, logical.

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

# iBGP

Loop prevention based on route suppression.<span
	style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Do not advertise iBGP learned route to
	another iBGP neighbor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So direct peering
	needed (or route reflection or confederation)

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

There is no next hop modification.<span
	style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To do this, you can do one of two things

*   **neighbor **_x.x.x.x_** next-hop-self<o:p></o:p>**
*   **route-map** &amp; **set ip next-hop **_x.x.x.x_

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

Route reflector – only thing not advertised is non-client
	route to non-clients.

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

# Confederations

Private range is last 1024 of range: 64512-65535

Inter-sub-AS is eBGP, but neighbors within sub-AS must be
	fully meshed or need RR.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So only
	behavior changed is between sub-AS, not within.

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

**Router bgp **_sub-as_**<o:p></o:p>**

**Bgp confederation id **_real-as_**<o:p></o:p>**

**Bgp confederation peers **_sub-as**<o:p></o:p>**_

**Neighbor **_x.x.x.x_** remote-as **_sub-as_**<o:p></o:p>**

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

If in confederation, we see sub-AS in brackets () in as-path

If outside, it is transparent and they don’t see the sub-AS
	in there.

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

Sub-AS do not update next hop value, even though they do
	eBGP peering within confederation sub-AS.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
	</span>eBGP peering only in the sense that send on prefix received from
	neighbor.

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

# Synchronization

If you have routes in the BGP table but they are not marked
	as best routes, check two things:

<![if !supportLists]><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:
	"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</span></span></span><![endif]>Do I have reachability to the next-hop

<![if !supportLists]><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:
	"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</span></span></span><![endif]>Synchronization

Issue because in BGP we only advertise our best routes.

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

There must be a match for prefix in routing table for BGP
	path to be considered valid path.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
	matching route learned from OSPF neighbor, OSPF router ID must match BGP router
	ID

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

Designed to prevent traffic black holes

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

Synchronization Solutions:

*   run
	     BGP everywhere – transit path knows everything
*   redistribute
	     BGP into IGP
*   Tunnel
	     BGP over GRE/MPLS – hiding the final destination from transit path.

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

By default when you redistribute BGP into IGP, only eBGP
	routes are sent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you want to send
	iBGP too, then you need **Bgp
	redistribute-internal**.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is so
	that you don’t run into loops.

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

Outbound routing policy affects the inbound traffic. <span

	but affects how traffic is sent to you.

# MED

BGP compares multiple paths based on order they were
	received.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>By default, MED is only
	compared if the first AS in AS-PATH is the same.<span
	style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, if these multiple paths were
	received apart, then they might not be lined up in BGP table adjacent and so
	in-between path might prevent their comparison.

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

For example suppose these three path were available (listed
	in reverse order of reception like BGP would show):

<![if !supportLists]><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:
	"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</span></span></span><![endif]>AS Path: 500, med 150, external, RID: 3.3.3.3

<![if !supportLists]><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:
	"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</span></span></span><![endif]>AS Path: 100, med 200, external, RID: 1.1.1.1

<![if !supportLists]><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:
	"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

	</span></span></span><![endif]>AS Path: 500, med 100, internal, RID: 2.2.2.2

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

When comparing, BGP would compare 1 &amp; 2 first.<span
	style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since AS is different, MED is ignored and it
	ends up deciding based on RID and picking 2.

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

If **bgp
	always-compare-med** is enabled, then it will always compare the MED,
	regardless of AS.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So in above example,
	it would compare MED and pick 1 due to lower MED.

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

If **bgp
	deterministic-med** is enabled, then it would group the prefix based on AS
	and then start the comparison once it has picked the best path per AS.<span
	style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So they would end up being arranged as:

<![if !supportLists]><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:
	"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</span></span></span><![endif]>AS Path: 500, med 150, external, RID: 3.3.3.3

<![if !supportLists]><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:
	"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

	</span></span></span><![endif]>AS Path: 500, med 100, internal, RID: 2.2.2.2

<![if !supportLists]><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:
	"Times New Roman"'><span style='mso-list:Ignore'>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	</span></span></span><![endif]>AS Path: 100, med 200, external, RID: 1.1.1.1

First it would compare all in AS500, picking 2 due to lower
	MED.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Similarly compare all from AS 100
	and pick 3 since it is the only one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
	</span>Then compare 2 &amp; 3 and pick 3 since it is an external route (MED is
	ignored since no **bgp always-compare-med**.<span
	style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If that was enabled also then 2 would have
	been picked).

# Summarization

**Aggregate-address**
	– requires at least one subnet of aggregate installed in BGP table, not
	necessarily the IP routing table.

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

Can let component subnets through in two ways.<span
	style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Either apply **suppress-map.** Or **summary-only**

	with an **unsuppress-map**.<span
	style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the latter, the **show ip bgp** will show the components with an _s** **_to indicate
	suppression but if you look at the **show
	ip bgp nei **_nei_** adv**, you can see them being advertised.<span
	style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Unsuppress-map is applied in the neighbor command
	while suppress-map is applied in the aggregate-address command.

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

By default aggregate-address also wipes out the AS path
	information.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you want to retain the
	AS information from the component subnets, use the **as-set** keyword after aggregate-address

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

Creating an aggregate with the **as-set** keyword increases risk that the other AS might drop it since
	they see their AS in the path.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So if
	have **summary-only** and **as-set** could be breaking reachability.<span
	style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>**Advertise-map**

	comes to the rescue allowing us to filter which AS we want to allow into the
	AS-SET by selecting only those routes (using route-map that matches an as-path
	list).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The aggregate is still one that
	encompasses all AS’s but the only ones showing in the AS-SET will be the ones
	matching our advertise-map criteria, so we get to “define” the AS-SET in
	effect.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Basically advertise-map means
	only advertise the aggregate if these specific routes exist, and not any
	component route of the aggregate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
	</span>Therefore, downside is that if the routes matching advertise-map
	disappear, then the aggregate will be removed.

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

Another way to allow external AS to receive this aggregate with
	AS information is the **neighbor **_nei _**allow-as-in**.<span
	style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This allows receiving the prefix from a
	neighbor even if our AS is in the path.

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

# Conditional advertisement

Used to control the direction of inbound traffic.<span
	style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Gives us more control than using MED/AS-PATH
	because in that case the other AS’s in between can override using weight/local
	pref and send traffic back to us via another inbound path.<span
	style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>With conditional advertisement, there is only
	one way for the traffic to go since only advertised one direction.<span
	style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Other direction only comes out if primary
	path fails.

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

**Neighbor **_ip_**
	advertise-map **_route-map1 _**non-exist-map**_ route-map2_**<o:p></o:p>**

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

Route-map2 matches the primary link and make sure it is
	available.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If it isn’t, then it
	advertises the secondary path listed in route-map1.

Both prefixes being matched need to exist in the BGP table,
	not routing table.

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

R3 is advertising the network.<span
	style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It wants R5 to use R1 to get to it so it
	as-path prepends out to R5.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However R1
	doesn’t like that and wants to use R5 to get to R3. <span
	style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>So it sets a higher weight on all routes
	coming from R5.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At this point since R5’s
	route is via R1, it will not advertise that back to R1, and so R1 only has one
	route in its table – direct via R3.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So
	have to clear neighborship with R3 till order of operation is such that the
	weight kicks in first.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then R1 will use
	R5 to get to R3, and R5 will go direct

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

So if R3 really wanted to control the path, and not let R1
	override it, it would conditionally advertise the network only out via R1.<span
	style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And advertise it out R5 when the link between
	R3 and R1 goes down only.

# Conditional Route Injection

Prefix origination

*   Network
*   Redistribution
*   Conditional
	     route injection

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

Originate component subnets from a received aggregate subnet
	for traffic engineering

**Bgp inject-map**_ inject_** exist-map**_ exist<o:p></o:p>_

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

Inject-map: prefix-list to originate (**set ip address prefix-list**)

Exist-map: match the aggregate prefix (**match ip address prefix-list**) and source of aggregate (**match ip route-source prefix-list**)

The source has to be defined in a prefix-list (/32 mask
	obviously)**<o:p></o:p>**

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

# Outbound route filtering

Traditional route filtering, upstream provider sends

*   full
	     bgp table
*   default
	     only
*   default
	     plus local
*   no
	     complex view

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

Inbound filtering on downstream neighbor is useless since
	full view must still be processed by BGP inbound RIB (there is inbound and
	outbound RIB)

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

ORF allows downstream neighbor to control what upstream
	neighbor advertises

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

Requires the IPv4 address-family.

**Address-family
	ipv4-unicast<o:p></o:p>**

**Neighbor **_nei_**
	activate<o:p></o:p>**

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

Upstream neighbor should be configured to receive ORF

**Neighbor **_downstream_** capability orf prefix-list receive<o:p></o:p>**

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

Downstream neighbor should be configured to send ORF, and
	define the prefix-list

**Neighbor **_upstream_** capability orf prefix-list send<o:p></o:p>**

**Neighbor **_upstream_** prefix-list **_prefix _**in<o:p></o:p>**

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

To clear the bgp advertisement, you have to **clear ip bgp * in prefix<o:p></o:p>**

<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>

# Communities
