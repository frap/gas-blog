### Trying out cryogen

After a lapse of a few years, I am now trying to get my notes updated with my new flavour of programming language - clojure.
So trying out the static blogger [cyrogen](http://cryogenweb.org/docs/writing-posts.html) which I hope can help me get my notes up to date.

Lets us see how easy and automated it is. Alos will need to sort out my git skills.

Gas.
